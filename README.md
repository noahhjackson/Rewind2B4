- Hi, I’m NHJackson (@Rewind2B4)

- I’m interested in automation, all things raspberry Pi, a bit of arduino, and heaps of python. 

- I’m familiar with arduino code, python, matlab/simulink, and PLC programming (Omron, Beckhoff, etc). 

- I’m looking to collaborate on automation, computer vision, etc.
